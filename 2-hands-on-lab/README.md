# Hands-on lab

This hands-on lab is designed to guide you through the process of building and deploying Docker images to the Kubernetes platform hosted on Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS), in addition to learning how to work with dynamic service discovery, service scale-out, and high-availability.

At the end of this lab, you will be better able to build and deploy containerized applications to Azure Kubernetes Service and perform common DevOps procedures.

## Getting started

To prepare your environment for the lab, start by going through the [setup guide](setup-guide.md).

## Performing the lab

Depending on your background, there are two different labs that you can follow:

* [Developer lab](developer-lab.md)
* [Infrastructure lab](infrastructure-lab.md)
